bash-trash
==========

Implement a Trash-like functionality (recoverable rm) using bash scripts

To use :

- make them executable with `chmod +x`
- eventually add them to your $PATH
- `del` deletes a file and move it into the trash
- `trash` empty the trash (definitely !) 
- `restore` allows to restore a deleted file
